    "# The main reasons to use subqueries are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Sometimes they are the most logical way to retrieve the information you want  \n",
    "+ They can be used to isolate each logical part of a statement, which can be helpful for troubleshooting long and complicated queries  \n",
    "+ Sometimes they run faster than joins  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some people find subqueries easier to read than joins.  However, that is often a result of not feeling comfortable with the concepts behind joins in the first place (I prefer join syntax, so admittedly, that is my preference).\n",

    "# Subqueries must be enclosed in parentheses.  Subqueries have a couple of rules that joins don't:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ORDER BY phrases cannot be used in subqueries (although ORDER BY phrases can still be used in outer queries that contain subqueries).  \n",
    "\n",
