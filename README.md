# Excel-to-MySQL
## Course information
* This is Duke University's specialisation on Coursera, namely "Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business". [This is the course website.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/excel-mysql#about)
* There are in total 4 courses and one cournerstone project. I have finished all four courses, namely
  * Business Metrics for Data-Driven Companies
  * Mastering Data Analysis in Excel
  * Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau
  * Managing Big Data with MySQL
* I attended this specialisation on Coursera In June and July 2020. I found this course a very good tutorial for the "analytics" part of data science. While personally, I am more excited by the technical details of complex machine learning algorithms and statistical models, I have realised that 
the purpose of data science is not about those buzzwords. They are ultimately tools to solve real business problems using data. So by doing this course, I picked up and got myself familiar with data analytics toolkits including Excel, Tableau and SQL, and at the same time, gain insight into what 
data science in various business sectors is like. There are many lecture videos focusing on the business ideas, which are really helpful. The assignments are also on real business data sets which are eye-opening and also very fun to explore. They also constitute good exercising material to get
familiar with the tools learned.
